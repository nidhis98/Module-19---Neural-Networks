# Module-19---Neural-Networks

Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to utilize machine learning and neural networks to predict if applications funded by the company, Alphabet Soup, will be successful. This was carried out by examining a series of features within a dataset. A neural network is then created in order to decipher the positive impact Alphabet Soup may have on its applicants.

Results

The variables(s) we considered targeting for this model would be the “IS_SUCCESSFUL” variable, which determines whether the funding sent by Alphabet Soup was utilized successfully. The feature variables of our model are as follows: application type, affiliation, government classification, use of funding, type of organization, business status, income, special considerations, as well as the ask amount for loans. The variables which were removed from our input data were the “EIN” and “NAME columns, as they did not provide sufficient information to be used in our model.
